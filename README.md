Reinforcement Learning using Q-learning 
<p> We have 10x10 matrix with 4 actions : North, South, East, West</p> <br>
<p> The gamma used is 0.8</p>
<br>
<p>Initial state is started form State-0 or is equal with point (1,1)</p>
<p>In this case, I use Bellman Equation to update the Q table that has been initialized</p>
